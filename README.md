Emorec, APP facial emotion recognition for Android

This APP recognizes your emotions by analyzing your face. Basically, it detects two states: FUN and SUFFERING. Emotions like anger, disgust, fear or sadness are detected as suffer emotions and emotions like happyness or surprise as fun emotions. 
Firstly, the APP captures your neutral expression and then it recognizes the emotion by comparing actual and neutral face.

The APP also allows to show the facial regions and landmarks detected. 

If the APP crashes try to install from here (bigger APP but more reliable):
